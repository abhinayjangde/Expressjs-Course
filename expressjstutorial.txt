Check Nodejs and NPM is Install or Not ?{
    node --version
    npm --version

    You should get an output similar to the following.
    v18.12.1
    9.1.2
}

Node Package Manager(npm){
    npm is the package manager for node. The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community. npm allows us to access all these packages and install them locally. You can browse through the list of packages available on npm at npmJS.

    How to use npm?
        Globally − This method is generally used to install development tools and CLI based packages. To install a package globally, use the following code.
        npm install -g <package-name>

        Locally − This method is generally used to install frameworks and libraries. A locally installed package can be used only within the directory it is installed. To install a package locally, use the same command as above without the -g flag.
        npm install <package-name>
}

Install Express and Nodemon{
    npm init -y 
    npm install express or npm i express
    npm install -D nodemon or npm i -D nodemon
}

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res){
   res.send("Hello world!");
});

app.listen(3000);


How the App Works?{
    express() = The express function is a top-level function exported by the express module.

    const app express()
        The app returned by express() is in fact a JavaScript function, designed to be pass to node's HTTP server as a callback to handle request.
    app.get(route, callback)
        This function tells what to do when a get request at the given route is called. The callback function has 2 parameters, request(req) and response(res). The request object(req) represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, etc. Similarly, the response object represents the HTTP response that the Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request.

    res.send()
        This function takes an object as input and it sends this to the requesting client. Here we are sending the string "Hello World!".

    app.listen(port, [host], [callback]])
        port = A port number on which the server should accept incoming requests.
        host = Name of the domain. You need to set it when you deploy your apps to the cloud.
        callback = An asynchronous function that is called when the server starts listening for requests.
